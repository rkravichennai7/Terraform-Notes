# Explanation: - 

This Terraform configuration sets up and configures the requirements and provider for working with Azure resources. Let's go through each section in detail.

### 1. Terraform Block

The Terraform block is used to specify settings for Terraform itself, including versions and providers.

terraform 
{
  required version = ">= 1.0.0"
  required providers {
    azurerm = {
      source = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = ">= 2.0"
    }  
} 
}

- required version = ">= 1.0.0": This line specifies the minimum version of Terraform required to run this configuration. Here, it's set to require version 1.0.0 or higher, ensuring compatibility with Terraform 1.x features.

- required providers: This block specifies which providers are required for this configuration and where to get them.

- azurerm: This is the Azure Resource Manager provider for Terraform, which allows Terraform to manage Azure resources.
  
- source = "hashicorp/azurerm" specifies the provider's source. In this case, it’s from the Hashicorp provider registry, indicated by hashicorp/azurerm.
  
- version = ">= 2.0": This specifies the minimum version of the azurerm provider required. Here, it's set to >= 2.0, which means version 2.0 or later is needed.

By specifying the required providers, Terraform will ensure that the correct provider is installed before applying any configurations.

### 2. Provider Block

provider "azurerm" 
{
  features {}
}

- provider "azurerm": This block configures the azurerm provider, which is used to interact with Azure resources. 

- features {}: In the azurerm provider, the features argument is required, but it does not need to contain any specific settings here. It acts as a placeholder that allows Terraform to work correctly with the provider’s features and capabilities.

### Summary

This configuration ensures that Terraform is using at least version 1.0.0 and the Azure provider (azurerm) is at least version 2.0.

- It prepares Terraform to interact with Azure by defining the azurerm provider with an empty features block.
