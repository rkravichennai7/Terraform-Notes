# Infrastructure as Code Basics

### Step-01: Understanding Problems with the Traditional Way of Managing Infrastructure

1. **Time for Building Multiple Environments**:

    - In a traditional infrastructure setup, building and configuring environments (e.g., development, staging, production) can be a time-consuming, manual process. Each environment requires consistent configuration, which often involves setting up servers, networking, storage, and various dependencies. This manual approach can lead to delays, especially in large-scale or multi-environment setups.
   
2. **Issues with Different Environments**:

    - Each environment may have subtle differences due to manual configuration, which leads to inconsistencies. These inconsistencies can result in unexpected issues during testing or production, often termed "environment drift," where settings or configurations unintentionally vary between environments.

3. **On-Demand Scale-Up and Scale-Down**:

    - Scaling resources to meet demand is challenging with traditional infrastructure. Without automated, programmable provisioning, scaling resources up or down involves a manual process or, at best, limited automation. This lack of flexibility can make it difficult to manage costs and optimize resource usage, especially when demand fluctuates.

### Step-02: How IaC with Terraform Solves These Issues

1. **Visibility**:
   - Terraform uses declarative configuration files that describe infrastructure in code. This provides complete visibility into your infrastructure setup, as every resource and dependency is explicitly defined in a human-readable format. It allows teams to understand, review, and track all changes, making it easy to manage and audit infrastructure changes.

2. **Stability**:
   - Terraform ensures consistency across environments by using the same configuration files to deploy infrastructure repeatedly. The concept of a "state file" helps manage existing infrastructure, allowing Terraform to maintain stability across updates and prevent unintended changes. By enforcing configuration consistency, IaC reduces environment drift and the chances of deployment failures due to configuration mismatches.

3. **Scalability**:
   - With Terraform, scaling infrastructure on-demand becomes manageable. Terraform can dynamically provision and deprovision resources using configuration files that specify scaling policies. This flexibility is crucial for managing cost and performance, especially for applications with variable workloads.

4. **Security**:
   - IaC with Terraform improves security by automating the application of security best practices. Configuration files can specify policies, access controls, and compliance measures directly within the infrastructure code. Terraform can also integrate with policy-as-code tools, ensuring resources comply with organizational standards before deployment.

5. **Audit**:
   - Terraform configurations are version-controlled, providing a complete history of infrastructure changes. The state file tracks the current state of infrastructure, allowing teams to review, audit, and roll back to previous configurations if necessary. This audit trail is critical for identifying who made changes, what those changes were, and when they occurred, enhancing accountability and governance.
