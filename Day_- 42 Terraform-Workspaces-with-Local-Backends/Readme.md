title: Terraform Workspaces with Local Backend
description: Learn Terraform Workspaces with Local Backend
---

## Step-01: Introduction
- We are going to use Terraform Local Backend 
- We are going to create 2 workspaces (default, dev) in addition to default workspace
- Update our terraform manifests to support `terraform workspace` 
- Master the below listed `terraform workspace` commands
1. terraform workspace show
2. terraform workspace list
3. terraform workspace new
4. terraform workspace select
5. terraform workspace delete


## Step-02: Review Terraform Configs and make changes
- Copy `terraform-manifests` from `38-Terraform-Remote-State-Storage-and-Locking` and make following changes

## Step-03: c1-versions.tf
- Remove Backend block from Terraform Settings block if any present
```t
# Terraform State Storage to Azure Storage Container
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name   = "terraform-storage-rg"
    storage_account_name  = "terraformstate201"
    container_name        = "tfstatefiles"
    key                   = "terraform.tfstate"
  } 
```

## Step-04: c3-locals.tf
- What is **${terraform.workspace}**? - It will get the workspace name 
- **Popular Usage-1:** Using the workspace name as part of naming or tagging behavior
- **Popular Usage-2:** Referencing the current workspace is useful for changing behavior based on the workspace. For example, for non-default workspaces, it may be useful to spin up smaller cluster sizes.

- Replace `${var.environment}` with `${terraform.workspace}` for all resource names
```t
  rg_name = "${var.business_unit}-${terraform.workspace}-${var.resoure_group_name}"
  vnet_name = "${var.business_unit}-${terraform.workspace}-${var.virtual_network_name}"
  snet_name = "${var.business_unit}-${terraform.workspace}-${var.subnet_name}"
  pip_name = "${var.business_unit}-${terraform.workspace}-${var.publicip_name}"
  nic_name = "${var.business_unit}-${terraform.workspace}-${var.network_interface_name}"
  vm_name = "${var.business_unit}-${terraform.workspace}-${var.virtual_machine_name}"
```

## Step-05: c5-virtual-network.tf
- Update Public IP `domain_name_label` with `${terraform.workspace}`
```t
# Create Public IP Address
resource "azurerm_public_ip" "mypublicip" {
  name                = local.pip_name
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.myrg.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.myrg.location
  allocation_method   = "Static"
  domain_name_label = "app1-${terraform.workspace}-${random_string.myrandom.id}"
  tags = local.common_tags
}
```

## Step-06: Create resources in default workspaces
- Default Workspace: Every initialized working directory has at least one workspace. 
- If you haven't created other workspaces, it is a workspace named **default**
- For a given working directory, only one workspace can be selected at a time.
- Most Terraform commands (including provisioning and state manipulation commands) only interact with the currently selected workspace.
```t
# Terraform Init
terraform init 

# List Workspaces
terraform workspace list

# Output Current Workspace using show
terraform workspace show

# Terraform Plan
terraform plan
Observation: 
1. The names of Resources should have "default" in them in place of environment
2. Resource Group Name: it-default-rg
3. Virtual Network: it-default-vnet
4. Subnet Name: it-default-subnet
5. Public IP Name: it-default-publicip
6. Network Interface Name: it-default-nic
7. Virtual Machine Name: it-default-vm

# Terraform Apply
terraform apply -auto-approve

# Verify
Verify the same in Azure Management console
Observation: 
1. The names of Resources should have "default" in them in place of environment
2. Resource Group Name: it-default-rg
3. Virtual Network: it-default-vnet
4. Subnet Name: it-default-subnet
5. Public IP Name: it-default-publicip
6. Network Interface Name: it-default-nic
7. Virtual Machine Name: it-default-vm

# Access Application
http://<public-ip-dns-name>
```

## Step-07: Create New Workspace and Provision Infra 
```t
# Create New Workspace
terraform workspace new dev

# Verify the folder
cd terraform.tfstate.d 
cd dev
ls
cd ../../

# Terraform Plan
terraform plan
Observation:  
1. The names of Resources should have "dev" in them in place of environment
2. Resource Group Name: it-dev-rg
3. Virtual Network: it-dev-vnet
4. Subnet Name: it-dev-subnet
5. Public IP Name: it-dev-publicip
6. Network Interface Name: it-dev-nic
7. Virtual Machine Name: it-dev-vm

# Terraform Apply
terraform apply -auto-approve

# Verify Dev Workspace statefile
cd terraform.tfstate.d/dev
ls
cd ../../
Observation: You should fine "terraform.tfstate" in "current-working-directory/terraform.tfstate.d/dev" folder

# Verify Resources in Azure mgmt console
Observation:
1. The names of Resources should have "dev" in them in place of environment
2. Resource Group Name: it-dev-rg
3. Virtual Network: it-dev-vnet
4. Subnet Name: it-dev-subnet
5. Public IP Name: it-dev-publicip
6. Network Interface Name: it-dev-nic
7. Virtual Machine Name: it-dev-vm

# Access Application
http://<public-ip-dns-name>
```

## Step-08: Switch workspace and destroy resources
- Switch workspace from `dev to default` and destroy resources in default workspace
```t
# Show current workspace
terraform workspace show

# List Worksapces
terraform workspace list

# Workspace select
terraform workspace select default

# Delete Resources from default workspace
terraform destroy -auto-approve

# Verify
1) Verify in Azure Mgmt Console (all the resources should be deleted)
```

## Step-09: Delete dev workspace
- We cannot delete "default" workspace
- We can delete workspaces which we created (dev, qa etc)
```t
# Delete Dev Workspace
terraform workspace delete dev
Observation: Workspace "dev" is not empty.
Deleting "dev" can result in dangling resources: resources that
exist but are no longer manageable by Terraform. Please destroy
these resources first.  If you want to delete this workspace
anyway and risk dangling resources, use the '-force' flag.

# Switch to Dev Workspace
terraform workspace select dev

# Destroy Resources
terraform destroy -auto-approve

# Delete Dev Workspace
terraform workspace delete dev
Observation:
Workspace "dev" is your active workspace.
You cannot delete the currently active workspace. Please switch
to another workspace and try again.

# Switch Workspace to default
terraform workspace select default

# Delete Dev Workspace
terraform workspace delete dev
Observation: Successfully delete workspace dev

# Verify 
In Azure mgmt console, all Resources should be deleted
```

## Step-10: Clean-Up Local folder
```t
# Clean-Up local folder
rm -rf .terraform*
rm -rf terraform.tfstate*
```

# Explanation:-

### Step-01: Introduction

You are setting up Terraform Local Backend and using Workspaces to manage multiple environments (like dev, default, etc.) without duplicating code.

#### What are Workspaces?

- Workspaces in Terraform allow you to maintain multiple state files in the same directory.
  
- Each workspace has its separate state, allowing you to deploy the same Terraform configuration for different environments (e.g., dev, test, prod) using the same code base.

### Step-02: Review Terraform Configs

You are starting from a previously created Terraform project (38-Terraform-Remote-State-Storage-and-Locking) and now adapting it to support multiple workspaces locally (instead of a remote backend in Azure Storage).

### Step-03: c1-versions.tf

You remove the backend block to use local state instead of storing it in a remote location like an Azure Storage account.

backend "azurerm" 
{

}

This is skipped when using the local backend, which is the default if no backend is specified.

### Step-04: c3-locals.tf

Here, ${terraform.workspace} is used to dynamically pull the current workspace name (like dev, prod, or default).

#### Why is this useful?

- Helps differentiate resources by environment.
- Avoids hardcoding "dev" in your resource names or tags.
- Ensures unique naming conventions and prevents collisions.

You changed: rg_name = "${var.business_unit}-${terraform.workspace}-${var.resoure_group_name}"

Which becomes:

- it-dev-rg in the dev workspace
- it-default-rg in the default workspace

### Step-05: c5-virtual-network.tf

You update the domain_name_label in the public IP to include the current workspace. 

This ensures that: domain_name_label = "app1-${terraform.workspace}-${random_string.myrandom.id}"

Results in a unique FQDN per workspace, such as:

- app1-dev-xyz123
- app1-default-xyz123

This makes each VM publicly accessible with its own DNS name per environment.

### Step-06: Create resources in the default workspace

Here you:

- Initialize Terraform: terraform init.
- Show the current workspace: terraform workspace show â†’ default
- Plan & Apply the configuration: `terraform apply -auto-approve`

Outcome: Resources will have names like:

- it-default-rg
- it-default-vnet
- it-default-vm

- This helps distinguish resources deployed in the default environment.

### Step-07: Create a New Workspace and Provision Infra

Commands:

terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace select dev

- Each workspace has its folder structure: terraform.tfstate.d/dev/terraform.tfstate

- This keeps each environment's state isolated.

Then you run:

terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve

Outcome:

- Resources are deployed with names like it-dev-rg, it-dev-vnet, etc.
- Public DNS and VM names will reflect the dev workspace.

### Step-08: Switch Workspace and Destroy Resources

Switch to default workspace: terraform workspace select default

Then clean up: terraform destroy -auto-approve

Why?: - You only destroy the resources related to the selected workspace â€” safe cleanup per environment.

### Step-09: Delete dev workspace

To safely delete a workspace:

1. Switch to a different workspace (like the default)
2. Destroy all resources in the workspace you want to delete
3. Delete the workspace: terraform workspace delete dev

- You cannot delete the currently active workspace.

### Step 10: Clean-Up Local folder

rm -rf .terraform
rm -rf terraform.tfstate

This removes all local backend files and state.
