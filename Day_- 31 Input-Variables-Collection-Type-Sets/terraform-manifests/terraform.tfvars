# Explanation:- 

This snippet defines **Terraform input variables and assigns specific values to them. 

These values will be used in Terraform configurations to create Azure resources dynamically.

### 1. Business Unit Name

business_unit = "it"

- business_unit is set to "it".  
- This represents the department or organizational unit.
- It is used for naming conventions in resource creation.

Example Usage in Terraform:

name = "${var.business_unit}-${each.key}-${var.virtual_network_name}"

- If each.key = "dev2", the resource name becomes:
  
  it-dev2-myvnet
  
### 2. Environment List

environment = ["dev2", "myqa2", "staging2", "prod2"]
#environment = ["dev2", "myqa2"]

- Defines multiple environments (dev2, myqa2, staging2, prod2).
- Terraform will create resources for each environment.

- The commented line:
  
  #environment = ["dev2", "myqa2"]
  
  - Suggest a previous configuration where only dev2 and myqa2 were used.
  - The user expanded the list to include staging2 and prod2.

Effect in Terraform:

If used with for_each = var.environment, Terraform will:
- Create a Virtual Network for each environment (it-dev2-myvnet, it-myqa2-myvnet, etc.).
- Deploy multiple resources dynamically.

### 3. Resource Group Name

resoure_group_name = "myrg"

- The Azure Resource Group is named "myrg".  
- All resources will be grouped inside this logical container in Azure.

Example Usage in Terraform:

resource_group_name = var.resoure_group_name

- Ensures that all Terraform resources belong to myrg.

### 4. Resource Group Location

resoure_group_location = "eastus"

- Specifies Azure Region where resources will be deployed.
- "eastus" is one of Microsoft Azureâ€™s data center locations.

Example Usage in Terraform:

location = var.resoure_group_location

- Ensures all resources are deployed in the East US.

### 5. Virtual Network Name

virtual_network_name = "myvnet"

- Defines the name of the Azure Virtual Network.
- The networking infrastructure for the environment.

Example Usage in Terraform:

resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "myvnet" 
{
  name = "${var.business_unit}-${each.key}-${var.virtual_network_name}"
}

- For dev2, this results in:
  
  it-dev2-myvnet
  
## Summary

| Variable                 | Value                                  | Purpose |
|--------------------------|----------------------------- ----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| business_unit`           | "it"                                   | Prefix for resource names |
| environment`             | ["dev2", "myqa2", "staging2", "prod2"] | List of environments (Terraform creates resources for each) |
| resoure_group_name`      | "myrg"                                 | Azure Resource Group Name |
| resoure_group_location`  | "eastus"                               | Azure Region for deployment |
| virtual_network_name`    | "myvnet"                               | Name of the Virtual Network |


## What This Configuration Will Do

1. Deploy Azure resources in the myrg resource group in the East US region.
2. Create a separate environment for each stage (dev2, myqa2, staging2, prod2).
3. Each environment gets its own Virtual Network (myvnet).
4. Terraform will dynamically name resources using the business_unit.
