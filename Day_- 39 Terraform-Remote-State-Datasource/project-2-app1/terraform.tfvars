## What's Happening Here?

These are Terraform variables, most likely used to provide values to input variables defined in another file (like variables.tf). 

Letâ€™s go through each one:

### 1. business_unit = "it"

- Purpose: Indicates which business unit or department this infrastructure belongs to.

- Common Usage:
  - Used for tagging resources (e.g., tags = { business_unit = var.business_unit })
  - Helps in cost management, auditing, and organizing resources.
- Value: "it" â€” meaning this infra belongs to the IT department.

### 2. environment = "dev"

- Purpose: Specifies the deployment environment for the resources.
- Common values: dev, test, staging, prod.
- Usage:
  - Used to name resources uniquely (e.g., "vm-${var.environment}")
  - Tagging, automation conditions, or even conditional logic (count, for_each, etc.)
  - Enables environment-specific behaviors.

### ðŸ–¥3. virtual_machine_name = "app1-vm"

- Purpose: Provides the name for the virtual machine that will be created.
- Value: "app1-vm" â€” likely the hostname or Azure VM name.
- Usage:
  - Directly used in resource blocks like:
    
    resource "azurerm_linux_virtual_machine" "example" 
{
      name = var.virtual_machine_name
    }
    
  - Helps maintain consistency across environments and makes naming customizable.
