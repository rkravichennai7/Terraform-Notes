## Terraform Variables (Generic + Resource Naming)

The code snippet you're referring to is a variable definition block typically found in a terraform.tfvars, variables.tf, or inline in a Terraform module. 

### Generic Variables

business_unit = "it"
#environment = "dev"

#### business_unit

* Purpose: Categorizes the infrastructure based on the business function.
* Value: "it" (indicating this resource belongs to the IT department).
* Usage: This might be used in tags, resource names, or folder structuring.

  Example tag:

  tags = {
    BusinessUnit = var.business_unit
  }
  
#### environment (Commented Out)

* Commented: #environment = "dev"
* Explanation: This is a placeholder for the environment type (e.g., dev, test, prod), but it’s not currently being used.
* Potential Use: Prefixing resource names or tagging.

  name = "${var.environment}-vm"
  
### Resource-Specific Variables

These variables are intended to name Azure resources. Giving dynamic or parameterized names to resources is a good practice for consistency and automation.

resoure_group_name       = "rg"
resoure_group_location   = "eastus"
virtual_network_name     = "vnet"
subnet_name              = "subnet"
publicip_name            = "publicip"
network_interface_name   = "nic"
virtual_machine_name     = "vm"

#### resoure_group_name

* Typo: Should be resource_group_name
* Value: "rg"
* Purpose: Sets the name for the resource group in which other resources will be deployed.

#### resoure_group_location

* Typo: Again, it should be resource_group_location
* Value: "eastus" – Azure region where the resources will be deployed.

#### virtual_network_name

* Value: "vnet"
* Used to name the Azure Virtual Network created in Terraform.

#### subnet_name

* Value: "subnet"
* Used to name the subnet inside the VNet.

#### publicip_name

* Value: "publicip"
* Refers to the Public IP resource that will be associated with a network interface or virtual machine.

#### network_interface_name

* Value: "nic"
* Used for the Azure Network Interface Card (NIC), which connects the VM to the virtual network.

#### virtual_machine_name

* Value: "vm"
* Defines the name of the Azure Virtual Machine.
